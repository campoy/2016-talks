## Understanding Nil

[@francesc](https://twitter.com/francesc)

Is it a constant? A variable? Where is it defined? What is its type?
It has no type? It has all the types? Those are usual questions that
people learning Go ask and this talk answers all of them and more.

The talk covers the different contexts where nil is used, what it
means, the gotchas to be aware of, and some patterns where nil becomes
essential.

In parallel to the exploration of how nil can be used I will also
discuss the origin and history of nil in those contexts.
